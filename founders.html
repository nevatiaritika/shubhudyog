Also in the domestic field increased the sales especially machinery and spare parts by 300%.

									<h2>ANKUR NEVATIA</h2>
									<span>I Ankur Nevatia, born and bought up in Mumbai after completing my graduation and MBA got associated with Shubh Udyog in 2003.</span>
									<p>
									Thinking outside the box would mean cast off the atmosphere that envelops you, step out of the box and start to view things from a completely different perspective, completely unfiltered, open for suggestions, willing to empathize with other opinions but also ready to swim against the flood and to think what no one else has ever thought of..
									<br>
									Since 2003, I am in Procurement, Project Management, timely and safe execution of projects.
									<br>
									I was involved in many remarkable projects like Johnson & Johnson Ltd., Novartis Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., DSM Nutritional Pvt. Ltd., India Bulls Securities Ltd., etc.
